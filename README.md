## About The Project

Github jobs was a challenge from devChallenges.io
Unfortunately, the GitHub jobs API is deprecated right now. That's why I created this very simple project. I just wanted to mock the data responses very easily. I was using Mock service worker but it doesn't work well on production
I am not that much into the backend so please ignore this project.
